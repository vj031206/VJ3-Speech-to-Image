# üéôÔ∏è VJ3-Speech-to-Image Generator

A Python desktop application that listens to your voice in any language, translates it to English, and generates a unique AI image based on what you said. This project was developed as part of the Codexintern Python Developer internship.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **üó£Ô∏è Multi-Language Support**: Speak in your native language\! The app automatically detects the language and translates it.
  * **üñºÔ∏è AI Image Generation**: Utilizes a powerful AI model via the Gradio client to create high-quality images from text prompts. Used due to discontinuation of MonsterAPI
  * **üî¥ Live Recording**: A simple "Record" button to capture your voice input directly through your microphone.
  * **üñ•Ô∏è Modern UI**: Built with Tkinter and styled with ttkbootstrap for a clean and modern user interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vj031206/VJ3-Speech-to-Image.git
cd VJ3-Speech-to-Image
```

### 2\. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

  * **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * **On Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: `pyaudio` might have system-level dependencies. If you encounter issues on Linux, you may need to install `portaudio` first (`sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev`).

### 4\. Hugging Face Authentication (Important\!)

This application connects to a model hosted on Hugging Face and **requires you to be authenticated**.

1.  **Get a Token**: If you don't have one, create a Hugging Face account and generate an Access Token with `write` permissions here: **[huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)**.
2.  **Log In**: Run the following command in your terminal and paste your token when prompted.
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

This will save your credentials locally and allow the application to connect successfully.

### 5\. Run the Application

Once your dependencies are installed and you are logged in to Hugging Face, run the main script to launch the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

*(Note: Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your main script if it's different.)*
